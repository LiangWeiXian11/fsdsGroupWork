# Response to Questions

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
path = '~jreades/data'
file = '2022-09-10-listings.csv.gz'
url  = f'{host}/{path}/{file}'
local_url = f'../data/{file}'


if os.path.exists(file):
  df = pd.read_csv(file, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
else: 
  df = pd.read_csv(url, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
    # 下载该文件到本地 的data文件夹 -- lwx
  df.to_csv(local_url)

## 1. Who collected the data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )

:::

An inline citation: As discussed on @insideairbnb, there are many...

A parenthetical citation: There are many ways to research Airbnb [see, for example, @insideairbnb]... 

## 2. Why did they collect it?

::: {.duedate}

* Use the distribution of scenic spots and wards boundary to select non-tourism-oriented wards


( 4 points; Answer due Week 7 )

:::

```{python}
print(f"Data frame is {df.shape[0]:,} x {df.shape[1]:,}")
```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the data collected?  
Inside Airbnb:
The data used in the analysis were mainly from Inside Airbnb, which is independent. To be more specific, the website is not related to the official Airbnb site and is protected under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CCO 1.0) ‘Public Domain Dedication’ license. The data includes information such as the location, price, number of bedrooms, number of reviews, and other details about the listings. Moreover, the data from Inside Airbnb is typically collected through a combination of web scraping Airbnb's publicly available listings and analyzing this data for insights. Within Airbnb utilizes automated scripts to gather data from the Airbnb website in a methodical manner, with an emphasis on publicly accessible information from different listings.  Data is gathered via scraping and then assembled into a database.  This procedure involves organizing the data so that it can be easily analyzed and refining it by removing duplicates and fixing errors.
Points of Interest (PoI) data from Open Street Map(OSM):
The OSM POI points for London attractions were used in this study. Data for OpenStreetMap (OSM) is gathered using a range of techniques, mostly by volunteers in the community. These techniques include working with organizations, importing data, using GPS and manual surveys, and using local expertise. The data structure is made up of point data with attributes, such as geographic information, assigned to each data point.
London Borough Boundaries:
Official Ordnance Survey polygons showing Borough boundaries and reference code. Ordnance Survey is the British national mapping agency that provides geographic data for government, business, and individuals. Which is accessible from the London Datastore.
## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?


## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data raise? 

::: {.duedate}

* The data related to the property evaluation may involve the personal privacy of the host

( 18 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )

:::

## 6. With reference to the data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London? 

::: {.duedate}

* Hosts 房东类型 -- 聚类（中介&当地）

  地图
### path 1.1 find local owner --diff Hosts
(possible solution : number of house they have) {cluster 1}

*  (optional) Listing 房源类型 -- 描述性统计--（暂定）
  
  图表

* airbnb 的空间分布 （聚集或分散）


( 15 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )

:::

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (e.g. figures, maps, and statistical analysis/models), how *could* this data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London? 

::: {.duedate}

### 计算当地经济  path 1 economy 
(定量计算当地经济--local economy mutiplier )
rental per night (column) --{algorithm 1}--> diff owner's income --{algorithm 2}--> economy by areas 

( 45 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )


### 旅游区聚类  path 2 tourism areas
number of tourism destination + boundary in london --{cluster 2}--> by number of tourism destination by per areas --> 
（根据每个旅游区的旅游景点数量，划分旅游区和非旅游区）
