# coding Workflow

## path 1 economy 
rental per night (column) --{algorithm 1}--> diff owner's income --{algorithm 2}--> economy by areas 

### path 1.1 find local owner --diff Hosts
(possible solution : number of house they have) {cluster 1}


## path 2 tourism areas
number of tourism destination + boundary in london --{cluster 2}--> by number of tourism destination by per areas --> 
 

## path 3 output
path 1 (economy -- numeric) + path 3 (non-areas) -- > Visualization map  




algorithm 1
algorithm 2

cluster 1：by number of house owner's have
cluster 2：by number of tourism destination
